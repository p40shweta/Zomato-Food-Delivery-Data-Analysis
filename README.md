# Zomato-Food-Delivery-Data-Analysis

## Objective
The primary objective of this project was to analyze Zomato's food delivery data and gain insights into key business metrics such as service provider performance, user statistics, and food preferences (veg vs. non-veg). The project aimed to help Zomato optimize its operations and enhance the user experience by building an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## Problem Statement
Zomato collects vast amounts of data from multiple cities and regions, which is often siloed and unstructured. This makes it difficult for decision-makers to extract valuable insights. The challenge was to analyze user statistics, sales trends, and service provider efficiency to improve customer satisfaction and streamline food delivery processes.

## Project Overview
The project involved leveraging Power BI to analyze Zomatoâ€™s food delivery data by:
- Extracting data from multiple Excel sheets.
- Transforming it by cleaning and structuring for analysis.
- Loading the data into Power BI to visualize key metrics such as user statistics, sales trends (veg vs. non-veg), and service provider performance.
- Creating relationships between datasets to facilitate comprehensive analysis and ensure accuracy in the dashboard.

## Technology Used
- **Power BI**: For data transformation, analysis, and visualization.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For creating calculated columns and measures.
- **Excel**: The raw data was initially sourced from multiple Excel sheets.

## Visualizations Used
1. **Key Performance Indicators (KPI Visuals)**
   - **Visual Type**: KPI Cards
   - **Purpose**: Display high-level metrics such as Total Sales, Total Users, and Total Orders.

2. **Sales Trends Over Time (Veg vs. Non-Veg)**
   - **Visual Type**: Line Chart
   - **Purpose**: Show the sales trends of veg and non-veg orders over a selected time period.

3. **City-Wise Sales and Delivery Performance**
   - **Visual Type**: Map Chart (Filled Map) and Bar Chart
   - **Purpose**: Geographically display sales and delivery counts across different cities.

4. **Service Provider Performance**
   - **Visual Type**: Stacked Bar Chart or Clustered Bar Chart
   - **Purpose**: Compare the performance of various service providers (delivery partners).

5. **User Statistics (Active Users, New Users, and Repeat Users)**
   - **Visual Type**: Pie Chart or Donut Chart
   - **Purpose**: Break down user statistics into categories such as Active Users, New Users, and Repeat Users.

6. **Order Volume by Time of Day**
   - **Visual Type**: Area Chart or Heatmap
   - **Purpose**: Show the distribution of orders throughout the day to identify peak times.

7. **Food Category Breakdown**
   - **Visual Type**: Tree Map or Stacked Bar Chart
   - **Purpose**: Visualize the most popular food categories (e.g., Biryani, Pizza, Burgers).

8. **Delivery Time Analysis**
   - **Visual Type**: Gauge Chart or Box and Whisker Plot
   - **Purpose**: Display average delivery times and highlight any delays.

9. **Customer Ratings and Feedback Analysis**
   - **Visual Type**: Star Rating Visual or Bar Chart
   - **Purpose**: Show average customer ratings and analyze feedback on food quality and delivery.

## Outcome
- An **interactive Power BI dashboard** was created, allowing Zomato's management to make informed decisions based on real-time data.
- **Sales trends** were visualized for both veg and non-veg orders, helping with demand forecasting.
- **Service provider performance** metrics allowed Zomato to identify top-performing vendors and areas for improvement.
- **Customer satisfaction** was analyzed through ratings and feedback, helping Zomato enhance user experience.

## Project Workflow
1. **ETL Process**: Data was extracted, transformed, and loaded into Power BI using Power Query Editor.
2. **Data Modeling**: Relationships were created between different datasets for comprehensive analysis.
3. **Dashboard Creation**: An interactive dashboard was built using various visualizations mentioned above.
4. **DAX Calculations**: Measures were created using DAX to calculate custom metrics such as average order time and sales trends.

## Challenges Faced
- Data inconsistencies required extensive cleaning before analysis.
- Complex DAX measures needed trial and error for custom metrics.
- Large datasets caused performance issues, which were solved through optimization techniques.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of Power BI in solving real-world business problems in the food delivery industry. By tackling challenges related to data cleaning, modeling, and visualization, the Zomato Food Delivery Data Analysis project empowered Zomato to make data-driven decisions and improve overall customer experience.
